routerLink = "index" // will pass the 'index'  to the link i.e. www.localhost/index
/ wont be added autmatically you have to add it in the Routes of your routing modules.

[routerLink] = "index" // will pass the value of the variable index to the Link

[routerLink] = ["index"] i dont know but it somewhat function like previous one ======= >  [routerLink] = "index"  


	******routerLink is used in anchor tags*********

Tip : 
always add static routes before dynamic routes in Routes arrays i.e.

"new"   -> static
":id"   -> dynamic


router: Router -> it is used to navigate just like routerLink but it is used inside ts methods
